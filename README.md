# 🏛️ Convert Roman Numerals With Python  

This project demonstrates how to convert **Roman numerals** into integers using Python.  
It is a beginner-friendly project that uses **functions, loops, and control flow statements** to solve the problem step by step.  

---

## 📖 Introduction  

Roman numerals originated in ancient Rome more than 2,800 years ago.  
Even today, they are still used in clocks, movie titles, and various everyday contexts.  

For example:  
- `IV` → 4  
- `XIII` → 13  
- `CMXL` → 940  

While simple numerals are easy to read, longer sequences can be confusing.  
This project provides a Python script to **automatically convert Roman numerals into integers**.

## ⚙️ Features  

- Handles standard Roman numerals (`I, V, X, L, C, D, M`).  
- Supports subtractive notation (`IV = 4`, `IX = 9`, `XL = 40`, etc.).  
- Easy-to-use: run the script and input any Roman numeral.  
- Beginner-friendly and well-commented code.
