## 📖 Introduction  

Roman numerals originated in ancient Rome more than 2,800 years ago.  
Even today, they are still used in clocks, movie titles, and various everyday contexts.  

For example:  
- `IV` → 4  
- `XIII` → 13  
- `CMXL` → 940  

While simple numerals are easy to read, longer sequences can be confusing.  
This project provides a Python script to **automatically convert Roman numerals into integers**.
